Dialogs contain text and UI controls. They retain focus until dismissed or a required action has been taken. Use dialogs sparingly because they are interruptive.

Most of the details about dialogs have been covered in Bootstrap modal docuementation. Please refer to [this page]({{ site.url }}/components/modal/index.html) for more details.
