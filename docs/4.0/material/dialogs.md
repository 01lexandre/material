Dialogs contain text and UI controls. They retain focus until dismissed or a required action has been taken. Use dialogs sparingly because they are interruptive.

Most of the details about dialogs have been covered in Components/Modal docuementation. Please refer to [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/{{ site.docs_version }}/components/modal/) for more details.

**N.B.** According to Material Design, flat buttons should be used in dialogs. In addition, the affirmative button should be placed on the right while the dismissive button should be placed on the left while both should use the same colour, ideally, info or primary colour.
