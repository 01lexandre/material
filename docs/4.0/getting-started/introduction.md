## Starter template

Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look like this:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta content="initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width" name="viewport">

    <!-- CSS -->
    <!-- Add Material font (Roboto) and Material icon as needed -->
    <link href="{{ site.cdn.md_font }}" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="{{ site.cdn.md_icon }}" rel="stylesheet">

    <!-- Add Material CSS, replace Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link href="css/material.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <!-- Optional JavaScript -->
    <!-- jQuery first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS -->
    <script src="{{ site.cdn.jquery }}"></script>
    <script src="{{ site.cdn.popper }}"></script>
    <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Then Material JavaScript on top of Bootstrap JavaScript -->
    <script src="{{ site.baseurl }}/js/material.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

That's all you need for overall page requirements.

## Important globals

Material employs a handful of important global styles and settings that you'll need to be aware of when using it, all of which are almost exclusively geared towards the *normalization* of cross browser styles. Let's dive in.

### Box-sizing

For more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global `box-sizing` value from `content-box` to `border-box`. This ensures `padding` does not affect the final computed width of an element, but it can cause problems with some third party software like Google Maps.

On the rare occasion you need to override it, use something like the following:

{% highlight scss %}
.selector-for-some-widget {
  box-sizing: content-box;
}
{% endhighlight %}

With the above snippet, nested elementsâ€”including generated content via `:before` and `:after` will all inherit the specified `box-sizing` for that `.selector-for-some-widget`.

### HTML5 doctype

Material requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, you'll see some funky incomplete styling, but including it shouldn't cause any considerable hiccups.

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

### Responsive meta tag

Material is developed *mobile first*, a strategy in which we optimize code for mobile devices first and then scale up components as necessary using CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, **add the responsive viewport meta tag** to your `<head>`.

{% highlight html %}
<meta content="initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width" name="viewport">
{% endhighlight %}
